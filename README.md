#README.md
This is a curated space with a compilation of elite cheat sheets to help you navigate some of the 
facets of information security, data management, project management, web design, so on and so forth.
At the time of creation I am currently enrolled in a program called "Code Differently" and am a 
proud member of the "Code Society". 

Cohorts are expected to keep ethics at the forefront of all digital endeavors and I do my best to 
represent my colleagues, teachers and mentors at all times. With that said, if you notice any repo's
designed or created for vulnerability exploitation, these are to be used in an ethical capacity and
are for research purposes only. Proof of Concepts (poc's) that target 3rd party websites, services, 
databases etc. should not be tested on random targets. Remember that with great power comes great 
responsibility and at no time should you be using these scripts to target anyone without their consent.
